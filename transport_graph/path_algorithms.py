## @package YenKSP
# Computes K-Shortest Paths using Yen's Algorithm.
#
# Yen's algorithm computes single-source K-shortest loopless paths for a graph
# with non-negative edge cost. The algorithm was published by Jin Y. Yen in 1971
# and implores any shortest path algorithm to find the best path, then proceeds
# to find K-1 deviations of the best path.

## Computes K paths from a source to a sink in the supplied graph.
#
# @param graph A digraph of class Graph.
# @param start The source node of the graph.
# @param sink The sink node of the graph.
# @param K The amount of paths being computed.
#
# @retval [] Array of paths, where [0] is the shortest, [1] is the next
# shortest, and so on.
